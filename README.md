# Predicting-Wildfires

Team: Mahrukh Khan, Mayank Bansal

Project: Predicting the size, class, and location of wildfires in U.S.

Data: We will use data on the U.S. wildfires available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/capcloudcoder/us-wildfire-data-plus-other-attributes). The data set contains over 50,000 wildfire records and 43 features, including information on various wildfires that occurred in the United States, including the fire name, fire size, fire size classification, cause of the fire, latitude, and longitude of the fire's location. Other information includes the date of the fire's discovery and containment, the discovery month, and the weather conditions around the time of the fire, such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and precipitation, measured at different time intervals before and after the fire's discovery. Additional information, such as fire magnitude and remoteness of the fire's location, is also included.

Models: 
- Regression - Fire size 
- Multiclass Logistic Regression - Class of the fire
- Clustering - Location of the fire
